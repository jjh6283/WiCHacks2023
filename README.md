### Inspiration
Our inspiration for gAInz was our love for working out and eating healthy. Especially with diet culture and misinformation it is hard to know what is the best workout and meal plan for you and your goals. We wanted to create a product that allowed people of any skill level to be able to create a workout or meal plan that works best for them.
### What it Does
gAINz is a web application that utilizes OpenAI to curate personalized fitness and meal plans tailored to user-inputted preferences and necessities. Once the specified plan is created, the user can even choose to have the weekly plan texted to their phone!
### How it Works
It was created in IntelliJ using an Angular Framework which utilizes CSS, HTML, and TypeScript for front-end development and the backend is run using node.js and express.js. Twilio API was used to allow for text notifications and the application is also deployed to the cloud using the GoogleCloud App Engine and Cloud Storage Bucket.
### Challenges
The biggest challenge faced was figuring out how to incorporate OpenAI into the code as well as establishing the connection between the front-end and back-end required to send the user responses to the AI generator. 
### Accomplishments
The use and implementation of Twilio was a big accomplishment as not many of our members had much experience with using it.
### Lessons Learned
We learned that there is a lot that goes into making a project from start to finish as there are many frameworks and applications that can be used. In addition, we learned that it is okay to not know everything. This experience solidified some basics and allowed for a strengthened foundation that can now be utilized for other personal projects. It also gave us a better understanding of areas of coding that we are more passionate about which is sure to give us more direction for personal research in the future. 
### What's Next?
The best way to improve the fitness and meal plans for gAInz is through the implementation of tutorials. We are seeking to incorporate video tutorials for our fitness plans or step-by-step recipes for our meal plans. We wish to include these features for ease and importance as having tutorials showing how to use proper form for exercises is extremely important to prevent injury and having detailed recipes for the meal plans would allow for more incentive and information to produce the foods detailed in the meal plans.
Another feature we are working to implement is the ability to have the application send notifications of the meal or fitness plan in the morning as a daily reminder.
Furthermore, we would like to implement a feature for the user to have the ability to send the number a request for a meal or fitness plan through a text and have one be curated directly without the use of the web application.
